# BVB Mac Setup

Setting up a new development environment is always a tedious task, minor tools can be missed if done
manually, and consumes time that can be used doing other things. A personal development environment
is also extremely important to enable one's greatest productivity. An automated setup of a new
development environment can take out the manual and tedious process whilst ensuring the ideal
environment is setup for the best productivity.

This project will configure and automate the setup of my development environment for any macOS
machine I use.
